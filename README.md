# Extended Macro-Keyboard
This project is intended to extend the existing DIY open source macro keyboard with 15 mechanical switches created by KiKiHobbyRepair. The goal is it to make a larger base and build additional buttons for various gaming purposes (e.g. Farming, Racing or Trucking Simulator).
